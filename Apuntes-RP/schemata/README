Abstract

The schemata package facilitates the creation of topical schemata, outlines that use braces (or facsimiles thereof) to illustrate the breakdown of concepts and categories in Scholastic thought from late medieval and early modern periods. This packages functions with both plain TeX and LaTeX.

Files

README		This file 	(normally in TEXMFDIST/doc/generic/schemata)
schemata.pdf	Documentation	(normally in TEXMFDIST/doc/generic/schemata)

Makefile	Automates building with GNU make 3.81
schemata.ins	Installer
schemata.dtx	LaTeX file containing both code and documentation. 

Installation

Unpack schemata.zip.

Generate the file schemata.sty, e.g.:
	$ pdflatex schemata.ins

Usually this will go in TEXMFDIST/tex/generic/schemata.

Generate the documentation:
	$ pdflatex schemata.dtx
	$ makeindex -s gglo.ist -o schemata.gls schemata.glo
	$ makeindex -s gind.ist -o schemata.ind schemata.idx
	$ pdflatex schemata.dtx
	$ pdflatex schemata.dtx

I used GNU make to automate the process:
	$ make

Create the directories listed above. For TeX Live, TEXMFDIST is often /usr/local/texmf/<year>/texmf-dist on Posix-compliant systems. Manual installation calls rather for /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local or ~/texmf.

MacTeX and MikTeX differ. Please refer to your distribution manual.

Copy the distribution files to their appropriate destinations.

Run mktexlsr with the appropriate level of permissions.

Source distribution notes:

Testing notes:

This package is designed purposefully to be very basic.

For testing purposes, the make file permits one to change the typesetting engine on the command line. The default is to build the package with pdflatex. See Makefile for more details.
